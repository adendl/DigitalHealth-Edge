# Edge Health IoT Processing
This project demonstrates how Red Hat technology such as Microshift, AMQ Streams (Kafka) and the Java Quarkus framework can be used on edge devices placed in hospitals or other clinical locations to process health IoT data closer to the source.

# Technologies Used
Red Hat Microshift for container orchestration and management
Red Hat Kafka for real-time data streaming
Node.js for the microservice that receives and processes the vitals data
Node.js for the application that consumes the data from Kafka topic and uses AI/ML model
